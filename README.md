# Text Summarization Website with BART (Hugging Face Transformers), Waitress Server, HTML, and Python

This project is a text summarization website that employs BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classes from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The website provides an interface for users to input text and receive a summarized version of the input text.

## Components

### 1. BART (Hugging Face Transformers)

The BART classes are utilized for text summarization. BART is a transformer model that can perform various natural language processing tasks, including text summarization.

### 2. Waitress Server

The Waitress server is used to host the website. It provides a simple and efficient multi-threaded server for serving web applications built in Python. It helps in handling HTTP requests for the text summarization service.

### 3. HTML Page

An HTML page forms the user interface of the website. It allows users to input text that they want to be summarized. The HTML page is designed to interact with the Python backend for text summarization.

### 4. Python

Python is used for the backend functionality. It handles the text summarization process, taking input from the HTML interface, utilizing the BART classes to summarize the text, and sending back the summarized text to the user via the HTML page.

### 5. Virtual Environment

The entire project is developed within a virtual environment. This ensures a contained and isolated environment for installing and managing dependencies, preventing conflicts between different projects' dependencies.

## Usage

1. Set up a virtual environment and activate it.
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Waitress server using Python: `python server.py`.
4. Access the website through a web browser by navigating to the specified URL.

## Directory Structure

- `app.py`: Contains the BART summarization logic.
- `waitress_config.py`: Implements the server using Waitress for hosting.
- `index.html`: Provides the HTML interface for user input.
- `requirements.txt`: Includes the necessary Python libraries and their versions.
